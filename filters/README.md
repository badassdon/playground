[Canvas Image Filters](http://www.hackyon.com/playground/filters/) - 
======================

JavaScript implementations of image filters (Hue, Saturation, Contrast, etc.) by manipulating pixel data on a HTML5 canvas. There are some plans to port this project as a polyfill for CSS3 filters.

The source is built using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/). Filters can be found in separate files under ```src/```.
